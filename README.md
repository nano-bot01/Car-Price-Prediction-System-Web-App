# Car-Price-Prediction-Model


This project is a web application that uses a regression-based machine learning model to predict the price of a car. The model is trained on a dataset of historical car sales data, and it can be used to predict the price of a car given its make, model, year, mileage, and other features. The web application is built using the Flask framework, and it is hosted on Heroku.

The project is still under development, but it is already able to predict the price of a car with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The project is open source, so anyone can contribute to its development.

Here are some of the features of the project:

- It uses a regression-based machine learning model to predict the price of a car.
- The model is trained on a dataset of historical car sales data.
- The web application is built using the Flask framework.
